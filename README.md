# BeepBoop Project

## Requirements

Uses [this](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) project to allow for Makefile building. This requires the Arduino IDE to be installed, but once installed the user does not need to open it.

### Mac Quick Install

```
brew tap sudar/arduino-mk
brew install arduino-mk
python3 -m pip install pyserial
```

You may need to update the Makefile for your system, modify the necessary variables.
